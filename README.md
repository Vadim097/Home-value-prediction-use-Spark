Prediction of median cost of housing in california
This project indicate median cost of housing in California in 1990. The project considers two logistic regression models with different feature sets. A comparison of models was made and the best one was determined. The project implements a distributed computing approach based on the Hadoop ecosystem, namely Apache Spark. Apache Spark is a data processing framework that can quickly perform processing tasks on very large data sets, and can also distribute data processing tasks across multiple computers, either on its own or in tandem with other distributed computing tools. The main goal of the project is to show practical knowledge of Apache Spark.
